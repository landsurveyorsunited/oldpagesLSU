primary goals involved in being a network admin are to A) Get existing
members to return to the network and share something or participate in
discussions already on the network and B) Help members find where it is
that they should be contributing to the network. &nbsp;As we are
working hard on getting funding and sponsorship for the network, it is
important that we continue to assist in helping existing members become
active contributors to the network and community. &nbsp;With that said,
I have written down a list of daily tasks that I myself try to do each
and every day. &nbsp;As an administrator, I am asking that you pick at
least 5 tasks on this list and accomplish them each and everyday.
Shortly down the road we hope to be able to pay moderators and admins
for their commitment to the network. &nbsp;Performing at least 5 simple
tasks everyday will help that day come much sooner.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Reach Out and Introduce Yourself to at least 5 Members</span><br>You
can run a search on the network in the top right for a place, topic,
subject or person and find at least 5 other members that you would like
to engage with. &nbsp;Help them find their local group on the network
and encourage them to start a new discussion in the forum and share
something related to surveying in that place specifically.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Start a New Discussion Inside a Group Your Belong to or Join New Groups</span><br>Every
single group on the network has its own forum inside. &nbsp;You can
find this forum by adding '/forum' to the end of the URL (for example:
http://landsurveyorsunited.com/group/surveyorscanada/forum for Canada
Land Surveyors Group). Every member has a unique set of groups that
they belong to or should belong to based on Location, Type of Equipment
and Types of Surveying they are involved with.<br><a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/about">Find all groups for Places</a> <br><a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/survey-equipment-support-groups">Find All Groups for Equipment Types</a><br><a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/page/surveyor-group-forum-search">Quick Search for groups based on Topics</a><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Add A Page to a Group</span><br>Only
Moderators and Admins can add pages inside groups. &nbsp;This means
that pages can be created inside groups that can serve as a resource, a
map, a set of videos, an embedded PDF or document or especially useful
links to other resources. &nbsp;For example, inside the <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/group/unitedstatessurveyors">United States Land Surveyors Group</a> a page has been added for <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/group/unitedstatessurveyors/page/latitude-and-longitude-of-us-states">Latitude and Longitude of US</a>...<a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/group/unitedstatessurveyors/page/all-50-us-state-groups-in-one-page">All 50 state groups in one place</a> (a more advanced page)...and a <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/group/unitedstatessurveyors/page/united-states-land-surveyors-on-facebook">facebook widget for US Land Surveyors</a>.
&nbsp;You can actually go to any state board website and find useful
links dedicated to land surveying in that state and create a page for
them. &nbsp;For groups that are not dedicated to a location, you can
make pages dedicated to similar videos or photos. &nbsp;For example, in
the Topcon group, you could create a page that is dedicated to all
photos on the network that have a topcon instrument featured in them.
&nbsp;Embed them into a page and call it something like "Land Surveyors
United Members Using Topcon." &nbsp;We have over 250+ different group
forums. &nbsp;Creating resource pages with a map is always a good idea!
<a href="http://gmaps-samples.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/simplewizard/makestaticmap.html">Here is a wizard</a>
for creating a map. &nbsp;It is always a good idea to write a small
descriptive paragraph of what the page will be about before embedding
anything into the page so that search engines know what the page is
about.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Upload Photos to the Network and give them proper titles, description, subject tags and Geolocation</span><br>Photos
without descriptions, Titles and Tags do not help the network one bit.
&nbsp;This is why as moderators we must at times come behind a member
who has not given their photos proper descriptions and change them for
them (for example when someone uploads a photo through their phone.)
&nbsp;Simply find 5-10 photos which have bad titles and descriptions
and click "Own this" dropdown and "Edit" &nbsp;this will take you to
the edit screen where you can add a proper title (ie. "Oklahoma Land
Surveying" when the surveyor's profile shows they are in Oklahoma) a
description of what is going on in the photo or type of equipment being
shown in photo... change the URL to match the title with dashes (-)
separating words (ie &nbsp;oklahoma-land-surveying) and tags.
&nbsp;Tags are especially important because they serve as both a way to
have photos with same tags grouped together in categories AND groups
have a RSS feed inside them to automatically import photos and videos
with a certain tag (ie photos tagged with OK automatically get sent to
the Oklahoma group and show what surveying in Oklahoma is like visually)<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Run a search on Youtube or Vimeo for a surveying related video-find a good one with a lot of views </span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">and embed it into the network</span><br>You
can find videos to share here or by searching for keywords on Youtube
and Vimeo. &nbsp;Sharing videos for surveying equipment types, mapping,
surveying and geomatics generates the most engagement. &nbsp;To embed a
video, simply go to the video on Youtube and click Share&gt;Embed grab
the code and Paste it here. &nbsp;Then go back to the video and click
About, copy the description and replace the existing description in the
edit page on the network (because it only imports the first 150
characters of Description. Last, add subject tags for that new imported
video so that it can be grouped with others like it.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Find a member who has not contributed to the network in a while and reach out to them and invite them </span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">to participate in a specific discussion</span><br>There
are over 900,000 pages on LSU. &nbsp;Everyday close to 20 new members
join on the average. &nbsp;That is close to 20 new people everyday who
has never seen any of our discussions, photos, videos, or stories.
&nbsp;The more you get to know other members, the more you will know
what types of topics they might be interested in. &nbsp;Simply find an
old discussion which still has relevance and add something to it.
&nbsp;You can also click "Own This" and Stop Featuring it, then
refeature it and bring it to the top of the featured discussions.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Tell Us a Story.</span><br>Stories
are essentially blog posts but because most surveyors do not have the
slightest idea about what a blog is supposed to be, we call them
stories. &nbsp;Stories allow us to bring many different types of
content into a single post. &nbsp;For example, let's consider making a
story about Survey Markers around the world. &nbsp;Run a search for the
tag <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/photo/photo/listTagged?tag=benchmark">Markers</a> or <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/photo/photo/listTagged?tag=marker">Benchmarks</a> in photos (you can do the same in videos and forums). &nbsp;Now <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blog/new">start a new story</a>
and take the embed codes from the photos and videos and copy paste them
into the HTML version of the post editor- write a story around the
photos and videos and post it. &nbsp;You can then share it with the
members who's photos and videos you used in the story (as they will
tend to share these discussions with their friends and family on other
networks). &nbsp;The truth is you can use this method to write stories
about ANYTHING without having to even shoot a video or photo. &nbsp;<a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blogs/mine-your-experience">Mine Your Experience</a>!

a particular piece of content is "featured" on the network, it is
basically displayed as among the best or most useful in a particular
feature. &nbsp;For example, featured photos are those which are
especially good or interesting, with good titles, tags and
descriptions. &nbsp;Before you feature or re-feature content you can
edit it to make it more useful to the network by adding '/edit' to the
end of the URL and correct any mispellings, add a photo of the subject
if you have one or we have one on the network then republish and
feature it to bring it to the top. With over 900,000 pages there is an
endless amount of content to work with. &nbsp;Only admins and
moderators can edit content submitted by members...and members can edit
only their own content.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">Share Content on Facebook, Google+, Twitter, Linkedin and Elsewhere</span><br>If you haven't yet <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/settings/editProfileInfo">synced your profile</a>
with other social media accounts, you are missing out. &nbsp;Land
Surveyors United enables you to post simultaneous status updates to all
of your social media channels with a single click. &nbsp;When you have
your profile synced you can also share anything on the network with a
single click. &nbsp;For example, you can click Tweet This and it will
automatically generate a twitter message with title of post and link
back to the content. &nbsp;This is a terrific way to attract like
minded surveyors to your profile, build a following and blast your
reputation online into the stratosphere!</body></html>
