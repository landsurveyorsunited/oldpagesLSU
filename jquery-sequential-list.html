<h3>Getting Started</h3>
<p>After signing up for Land Surveyors United, you might be
overwhelmed
at where to start or where to jump in. Make sure that your <a href="/profiles" target="_blank">member
profile is complete</a> and reflects your accomplishments and
specializations as a geospatial professional. &nbsp;Pay special
attention to your "location" question, as it will be your marker for
the <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/page/new-lsu-member-map" target="_blank">Global Member Map</a>. Then, Ask
yourself one of the following
questions:</p>
</li>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">What do I
specialize in and what can I share?</span></li>
<li><span style="font-style: italic;">What kind of
techniques or technologies should I learn?</span></li>
<li>From
there, head over to our <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/explore" target="_blank">Explore
page</a> and find topics, meet other
professionals and/or upload some of your own content to the network,
such as <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/photo/photo/newWithUploader" target="_blank">photos</a> and <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/video/video/newWithUploader" target="_blank">videos</a>.<span style="font-style: italic;"><br />
</span></li>
<li>
<h3>Introducing Yourself</h3>
<p>When you join any professional network, one of the first
things you
should always do is find the place where everyone is making
introductions. &nbsp;That place is <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/forum/categories/introduce-yourself-to-the-land/listForCategory" target="_blank">here</a>. Simply <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/forum/topic/new?target=http%3A%2F%2Flandsurveyorsunited.com%2Fforum%2Fcategories%2Fintroduce-yourself-to-the-land%2FlistForCategory&amp;categoryId=544331%3ACategory%3A4801" target="_blank">add a new post</a> and Introduce
yourself and tell
the network where you are from, what you specialize in, what you care
to learn from the network and share any special projects or ideas that
you have. &nbsp;You can include photos and videos that you uploaded
if you like. &nbsp;You'll meet a few like-minded associates just
doing this step. &nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>On Land Surveyors United, you will find that our content is
structured in a way similar to a library. &nbsp;Like the sections
of a library where you would find types of content in groups, we have <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/groups" target="_blank">Group
Forums</a> based on <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/societies" target="_blank">Locations</a>,
Types of Surveying and Surveying Equipment Types. &nbsp;Asking
questions in the appropriate group forum will ensure that you get
replies from members who are also familiar with the topic.
&nbsp;Join a <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/groups" target="_blank">group forum based</a> on your location
and network with other surveyors in your area. &nbsp;Group forums
are also accessible by <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/m" target="_blank">our mobile interface</a>, so staying
connected has never been so simple.</li>
<li>
<h3>Contributing Content</h3>
<p>There are <span style="font-style: italic;">many
levels</span> of contribution on a network like Land
Surveyors United. &nbsp;The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">first</span> level
is simply commenting and
sharing content already on the network. &nbsp;When you see or read
something which interests you, simply click favorite, send a twitter
share or share it on your facebook page. We have made this super simple
for you, as you can join your social media profiles with your account
on LSU, by going <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/connections/edit" target="_blank">here</a>. You only need to do this
once and with one click
you can share anything on the network.&nbsp; The <span style="text-decoration: underline;">second</span>
level of
participation is uploading <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/photo" target="_blank">photos</a>
and <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/video" target="_blank">videos</a> from your computer or <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/m" target="_blank">phone</a>
while on the go. Photos are the cornerstone for a great explanation of
what your day-to-day surveying life is like. &nbsp;Please add
proper titles, tags, descriptions and locations to your photos, so that
other members understand them. Third level of participation makes Land
Surveyors United your own. &nbsp;Its always a good idea to
<a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/profiles/blog/new" target="_blank">share a surveying story</a>, add a new
discussion, upload or embed a video
or upload photos from the field. &nbsp;Remember that our stories
section of the site is different from the <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com/forum" target="_blank">forum</a>,
as stories are longer and filled with examples and details. </p>
