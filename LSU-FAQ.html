    <h1>The Land Surveyors United site</h1>
    <h2 id="a1">What is Land Surveyors United?</h2>
    <p><a href="http://www.streamate.com/?sakey=3fe4e38f26e4f47a">Land Surveyors United</a>&nbsp;is a live video chat site, where you can chat with amateur performers while watching them on webcam. <b>The chat and video on <a href="http://www.streamate.com/?sakey=3fe4e38f26e4f47a">Land Surveyors United</a> is live</b>
 (unless you've selected a pre-recorded show), so you can chat with the 
performer, and watch her or him chat back and perform just for you! <a href="http://www.streamate.com/?sakey=3fe4e38f26e4f47a">Land Surveyors United</a> performers broadcast video live from their homes to yours. We have performers of every type! <b>Browse models by sex, age, looks, and kinks. View gals, guys, couples, or specialty cam shows.</b>
 Learn more about each performer by going to their bio page or viewing 
their sample pictures. Once you've chosen the performer you're 
interested in, you can access the guest chat to talk with the performer 
and view a small sample of the stream. <b>It is completely free</b> to 
view the guest chat and sample pictures. If you would like to enter the 
performer's chat room and see the video stream, the prices for full 
access and pre-recorded video are stated before you enter the chat. Chat
 fees are a per-minute charge, and are shown in your currency.&nbsp;</p>
    <h2 id="a2">How can I find a land surveyor?</h2>
    <p><b>There are a lot of ways to <a href="http://www.streamate.com/advanced-search.html?sakey=3fe4e38f26e4f47a">browse</a> and search for a land surveyor.</b>
 If you know the name of the surveyor you're interested in, just type 
it into the search box and click the search button. If the name isn&#8217;t an
 exact match to a performer, we'll give you a list of the closest 
matches.</p><p>If you are looking for a certain type of surveyor, you 
can enter in any keywords into the search box to search&nbsp;surveyor 
descriptions.  You can also browse the expansive list of Categories 
we&#8217;ve compiled for you on the left side of the page to find a&nbsp;surveyor 
who fits your interests.  Simply click on the link of your choice and 
we&#8217;ll show you&nbsp;surveyor that meet your selection.</p><p><b>The most detailed way of searching for a&nbsp;</b>surveyor<b> is our <a href="http://www.streamate.com/advanced-search.html?sakey=3fe4e38f26e4f47a">Advanced Search</a>.</b>
 Just click the Search link on the navigation bar at the top of the 
page, and you will be able to search on just about anything you can 
think of.   Select as many or as few of the characteristics as you would
 like and we&#8217;ll display all the surveyors that match your selection, 
starting with the closest matches.  If you&#8217;re looking for an exact 
match, check the &#8220;Exact matches only&#8221; box to the right of the Search 
button before submitting your search.</p>
    <h2 id="a3">Are all videos live?</h2>
    <p><b>All of the video chats feature live video</b>, unless they are
 marked as being pre-recorded. With the live chats, you will be able to 
talk to and interact with the performer. Pre-recorded videos (available 
through the video membership) could be previous cam sessions or other 
performances recorded by the performer. You will be able to watch the 
video, but there will be no chat or interaction with the performer.</p>
    <h2 id="a4">How does the video chat work?</h2>
    <p>The performer has a camera set up on his or her end. When you log into the chat, <b>you can see what the performer is doing in real time</b>. To view the chat, you need to have the <a href="http://get.adobe.com/flashplayer/" target="_blank">Flash plug-in</a>
 for your browser. This is a fairly simple program.  If you don't have 
it, it should be easy to set up. If you do have it, it should provide 
flawless video streaming.</p><p>At the same time as you can see the performer, you can type chat back and forth with her or him. <b>Some performers will have a microphone set up to do audio, so they can talk to you!</b></p>
    <h2 id="a4a">What is GOLD?</h2>
    <p>GOLD is a type of currency (1 GOLD=1 unit user currency - e.g. 1 
Euro or 1 GBP) that you can send to the performer and is not tied to 
their private per minute rate. If you really like how the performer is 
interacting with you, giving GOLD is a great way to let them know how 
much you enjoy them.</p>
    <h2 id="a5">How do I talk to the performer?</h2>
    <p>When you enter a performer's full chat, you will see the video on
 the left, a large chat box on the right, and a small box at the bottom 
for typing your message. To talk to the performer, type into the small 
box, then hit the "Send" button or your enter key to send the message. 
Your message will appear in the chat box. When the performer replies to 
you, you'll see what she or he said in that box as well.</p><p>You can 
also participate in voice-to-voice chat with performers who have chosen 
to offer this option via our confidential phone system (Note that not 
all performers have this option enabled).  You must be in an exclusive 
chat session with the performer to use this service.  Most performers 
who have voice-to-voice chat enabled will have an icon indicating that 
they offer this service on the homepage.  You can also ask the performer
 if phone chat is an option and whether or not they are willing to 
enable the feature for you.   </p>
    <h2 id="a6">How do I leave the chat?</h2>
    <p>When you are ready to leave the chat, you can either click the 
"Disconnect" button at the top of the page, or select to visit another 
page on the site using the navigation bar at the top of the page. <b>Billing will end as soon as you've done this.</b>
  At the conclusion of your private session, you will be given the 
option to review the performer.  You can leave comments as well as 
provide rating information based on your session.</p>
    <h2 id="a7">What if a performer doesn't do what I ask?</h2>
    <p>This is what the guest chat is for! <b>Performers are not obligated to do anything you ask, but most are willing and happy to put on a show for you.</b>
 The guest chat is the perfect place to find out from the performer what
 he or she will and won't do. These are real people broadcasting from 
their homes, and they will have different likes and dislikes.</p><p>If you want to check to see what a performer will do for you, <b>please ask them in the guest chat</b>.
 If they don't want to do it, you can always find another performer. We 
have many different performers with different specialties and interests,
 so there should be one to fit your particular desire!</p>
    <h2 id="a8">What is high definition (HD) video?</h2>
    <p><b>High definition video or "HD" is a higher resolution, larger-sized video stream.</b> If you have a broadband connection, such as cable or DSL, this is one more feature for you to enjoy on <a href="http://www.streamate.com/?sakey=3fe4e38f26e4f47a">Land Surveyors United</a>!  When you see the&nbsp;<img src="http://m1.nsimg.net/2.0/shared/images/20110801/icon-hd.png" alt="HD" height="9" width="13">&nbsp;icon next to a performer's name, this indicates that they are streaming high definition video.</p><p>If
 you would prefer to see the smaller-sized video when a performer is 
streaming in HD, you can click the "From HD Screen Size" icon in the cam
 options menu at the bottom of your chat session.</p><p>Once you have logged in, you can <a href="http://www.streamate.com/speedtest/?sakey=3fe4e38f26e4f47a">test your internet connection</a> and help us deliver the highest quality video.</p>
    <h2 id="a25">What happens if the system disconnects me from a block session?</h2>
    <p>If either you or the performer loses connection, please reconnect to the session <b>within 2 hours of the start of the session</b>. <b>The price per minute will not be affected by the disconnection.</b> If you are unable to reconnect, please <a href="mailto:supportteam@streamate.com">contact support</a>.
 If you purposely disconnect before the Block Session is complete, or do
 not try to reconnect should an issue occur, you will be charged as 
agreed for the session. We may also remove your ability to purchase 
future Block Sessions.</p>
    <h2 id="a26">What is the maximum amount of time that I can receive the discounted price?</h2>
    <p>A block session can continue after the allotted time period <b>as long as the performer is available</b>. If so, you will receive the discounted rate for the whole session.</p>
    <h2 id="a27">Why aren't block sessions available?</h2>
    <p>Block sessions are available only when your daily limit permits 
this feature, and the performer has chosen to offer them. If you have 
used up a partial amount of your daily limit, you will only be able to 
select block sessions that would not exceed your set limit.</p>

of the home page and enter the information as you would any other card. 
Once the card has been authorized, you will be a member and have access

    <h2 id="b15">How do I add funds to my account?</h2>
    <p>If you have a prepaid account, there are two easy ways to do this:</p> <ul class="show-bullets"><li>If
 you have no funds available on your account, clicking to go into a gold
 show or a paid chat room will give you the option of adding funds to 
your account.</li><li>You can also click "My Account", then "Manage

    <h2 id="b17">Why is my prepaid card not working?</h2>
    <p>Upon initial enrollment a nominal transaction amount (or

verification and validity. <b>If you are unable to use your prepaid card
 you will need to call the number on the back of the card to request the
 card issuer approve this authorization.</b> You may find more information on this nominal amount in the first paragraph of our <a href="http://www.streamate.com/terms.html?sakey=3fe4e38f26e4f47a">Terms &amp; Conditions</a>.</p>

(VAT), as required by law, for all Land Surveyors United purchases. VAT is 
calculated at the time of billing, after the base charges are subtracted
 from your daily limit. VAT charges do not count towards your daily 
limit.</p><p>You will be notified of the VAT percentage you will be 
charged before a taxable purchase is made. This percentage differs based
 on country. Please consult your local government for details on how VAT
 applies in your area.</p>

    <h2 id="c15">How do I end my video chat session?</h2>
    <p>You can end the chat and stop the billing by navigating to another page or clicking on the disconnect button of the chat window.</p>
    <h2 id="c16">What happens if I am disconnected during a show?</h2>
    <p><b>If the chat closes, billing will stop</b>. If it was a 
technical problem on your end, you should be able to open your browser 
again and log back into the chat. You will also be disconnected if the 
performer leaves the chat. Performers are given the ability to block 
offensive users from their chat. This block is permanent for that 
performer.</p>
