Here in Louisiana every day brings something different . I worked for my dad to the day He passed in 62. I couldn't see wasting every thing he had built so my sister and I just kept going. Now at 51 the scars and bars have taken there toll But I just walk a little slower and have now stopped trying to jump the creeks instead I just wade the water and keep going while the crew keeps looking back to see if I've made it up the other side yet. All in all it's been a blast. My main question is what happened to the comrodary between surveyors, we use to be a tight group, now evryone seems scared to venture out of thier own little circle. Does any one else sense this?<br><a target='_blank' href='http://maps.google.com/maps?q=32.514615,-93.747274&amp;t=k&amp;z=18' style='font-size:xx-small;font-family:Arial' target='_blank'>Zoom in!</a>","2","","","","","","","",""],

Following school, I worked for the City of Williston, ND, Engineering Department, then my wife, Michelle and I moved to Racine, WI in 1987 where I worked for a consulting Engineering and Surveying Company called Nielsen Madsen and Barber. It was while in Racine where our oldest Daughter Brittany was born in 1990. In 1992, I accepted a job with Welch Land Surveying in Redgranite, WI. In 1994, our youngest daughter, Mariah, came along into our lives... Brittany finally got a baby sister! (all my boys are girls). In 1995, after Bob Welch lost the US Senate election to Senator Herb Kohl, I purchased the business from Bob. In 1997, I purchased Schindler Land Surveying in Wautoma, WI. Somehow around that same time I started into Commercial real Estate Development, and started 2 realestate development firms which are still operating today.

We hubbed and tacked every 100' of 4 miles to check/find original PIs, POTs, PCs, &amp; PTs. Our crews were shot at and crop-dusted and I thought; what a cool job! I knew nothing of surveying; I actually thought it was a dead profession. Now, 40 years later, I wonder if it is or not. I continued to work for numerous engineering firms for 8 years. Then, I went to Ferris State College in Big Rapids, MI and got a 4 year BS in Surveying - that was May of 1981. Then I moved to MN, got licensed in MN, IL &amp; SD. Did three Cadastral contracts in the Black Hills - exciting b/c we found original PLSS corners and Bearing Trees. We busted 10 sections around MT. Rushmore, really cool. Then with my own survey business, we did GPS jobs in MN winter around CASS Lake &amp; Black Duck - snowmobiles, northern lights and logging trucks! Also in Red Wing along the high bluffs of the Mississippi; in Minneapolis duriing the great solar event of 1989; in Mankato; and in Northfield. I started doing GPS in 1987 and the first to use 5 Ashtechs and 4 Trimble 4000SDs simulltaneously in observation - what a nightmare!
