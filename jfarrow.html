<div id="about">
<p>Justin Farrow is the founder and principal of <a href="http://landsurveyorsunited.com" target="_blank">Land
Surveyors
United</a>, the world's first ever global social network for
professional
land surveyors and the geospatial industry. Aside from his continuing
pursuit to unite the geospatial industry in the name of support, other
projects include <a href="http://www.justinfarrow.com/projects/home-free-organization" target="_blank">Home Free Organization</a>, a unique
mobile support
solution to homelessness, Justin Farrow Media, social reputation
management for professional artists and musicians. In his free time,
Justin is a street photographer, mixed media artist and <a href="http://blog.justinfarrow.com/" target="_blank">blogger</a>.</p>
<p>He writes about social media as it relates to solving real
world problems in business and art, maintains several Twitter accounts
and Facebook profiles on behalf of his friends and clients and educates
all of those who he comes in contact of the ways to utilize social
media to build and manage reputable online brands. In the past, you may
have known him as the Loft Ninja, a renegade real estate broker in
<a href="http://blog.justinfarrow.com/search/label/Williamsburg" target="_blank">North Brooklyn, NY</a> who worked exclusively with professional artists and
those being evicted during mass gentrification to find new spaces to
live and work. Justin has a BA for Philosophy &amp; Religious
Studies and a BS for Anthropology, currently finishing his Masters in
Applied Cultural Anthropology. Soon, you can call him Dr. Justin Farrow
upon finishing his PhD for Applied Anthropology, in NY.</p>
<p>Presently, you can find JFarrow bouncing between school and
projects in Brooklyn, NY and his family in central Florida. He is a
freelance web developer, writer, street photographer and content
creator for many online projects. </p>
